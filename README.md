About: This program is created by SureRouge502 automating the process of using your Phone over wired or wireless connection in
       A linux machine. This program Uses ADB (Android Debug Bridge) and Fastboot in order to work..
       Works on All types of linux (Mostly tested on Debian And Kali coz i have those two only right now)

       Lets Move on to the installation process now...



Installation: 
--------------

Its quiet easy if i say so myself. infact just one piece of code to install all tools required to run this program

---> First, Give executable abilities to the program and the installer itself using the code 'You only need to do this once':

chmod +x install.sh linuxchat.sh

--->Now that you've given the executable permissions, You can now start the installation process itself by typing the command:

./install.sh

--->After that, you should get a message saying Installation complete and now you're ready to run the program itself
    In-order to run the program whenever u need it to...run the command:

./linuxchat.sh

Enjoy the program...
